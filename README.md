The player has 3 listening modes

single playback
alphabetical order
shuffle
and of course looping (even for single mode) the buttons of the portable console can be blocked - so that there is no accidental pressing in your pocket and additionally 7 equalizer presets (filter) I have not tested on different formats and do not know what the result will be - I only worked with mp3 files Using directories (and even nested ones) - you can organize collections - playlists

Nested mode on/off - press and hold X button

IMPORTANT: open Config.lua and specify path to the folder with your music!

–SET YOUR music collection path Config.BASE_DIR = “/mnt/sdcard/ROMS/music” Install via archive manager
